### 🏠 [Homepage](https://github.com/jrodriguezdiazz/book-search-engine)

## Getting started

This project was inspired by [florinpop17/app-ideas](https://github.com/florinpop17/app-ideas), in which one of the projects is a Book Finder. And to develop this web page I decided to use React and one Book API.

## Introduction

In locations the persons when they are looking for some books forget the name of the book, but they remember the author or some other data relevant to the book, with this premise I developed a search engine of books using React. UI material and a book API in order to be able to apply the acquired knowledge and provide a reliable and friendly tool for reading lovers.
